								<h2>Mini Drone<br />

								To really understand how they work, I've decided to finally build one myself.</p>

								<h2>Design 1<br />
								Day 1</h2>
								<p>To start off this project, I had the intention of further my understanding of drones. Despite me building drones 
									with already set kits, such as ones from VexCode that you buy off the internet, I feel like designing and creating
									drones with my bare hands through the materials found in my very house. This would be my first design, with 4 dc motors held up by 4
									precisely cut popsicle sticks, binded by hot glue.

								<h2>Design 2<br />
								Day 2</h2>
								<p>I realized my design previously was fairly heavy and not suitable enough for flight due to the lack
									of power which my motors had. So in response to this, I decided to remodel my design, more accurately
									in a CAD software to have a better approach. This design used half the materials, ending up with half
									of the weight of my original design.

								<h2>Final Project<br />
								Day 3-4</h2>
								<p>I finally set my sights on starting to build my mini drone, scaled 5.75in x 5.75in due to the size 
									my popsicle sticks found in the shelves of my garage. I found some old wires, propellers, and motors from 
									the previous drones that I built with my older brother years previously. After about 2 hours of assembling my drone, binded
									with messy plops of glue from my hot glue gun, which I burned myself about 10 times with, my drone was finally finished. I 
									attached the wires to 2 double A batteries and hoped for the best. But unfortunately it didn't fly.
								</p>
								<p> After 30 minutes of attempting to fix it I finally found the problem. One of my wires werent properly connected
									 leading to all of the motors not being able to work. After I fixed that issue, I unfortunately found another problem.
									  I somehow failed to account that just 2 double a batteries cannot provide enough power to 4 motors. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Ongoing to the next day, I had a new approach of wiring each motor to their own set of batteries. After I was done wiring,
									I turned each motor on and hoped for the best. And I finally did it, even though it wasn't perfect as it can only fly upwards, it finally took
									flight.

							<h2>VEXU Competition Robots For Push back<br />
							</h2>
							<p>After my experience of interning with The Aerospace Corporation, I wanted to apply my newfound technical abilities of prototyping and collaboration to a team of like-minded engineers. Eventually, I was able to apply my skills through the Cerritos College Engineering & Technology Club competing in VEXU.</p>

								<h2>Mount San Antonio College VEXU Competition<br />
								Role: Lead CAD Drafter/Prototyper</h2>
								<p> Preparing for my first ever robotics competition, I served as the role of Lead CAD Drafter/ Prototyper for my team. I worked with another team member to help develop the chassis for our robot. The VEXU competition that we were competing in was pushback, which is where we have to score balls in a goal having to outscore our opponents. 
									After doing research for potential designs, my teammate and I developed the X-Drive chassis and due to ease in being able to steer in all directions. After my interning and collaborating with fellow engineers during my internship, my technical skills in CAD drastically improved, being able to create multiple models for my team.
