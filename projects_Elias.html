								<h2>Mini Drone (2024)<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Ever since I was a kid, I've always been fascinated by the miraculous piece of engineering which drones are.<br />
								For my first ever project, I chose to finally build one myself in order to understand how they work.</p>

								<h2>Design 1<br />
								Day 1</h2>
								<p>To start off this project, I had the intention of further my understanding of drones. Despite me building drones 
									with already set kits, such as ones from VexCode that you buy off the internet, I feel like designing and creating
									drones with my bare hands through the materials found in my very house. This would be my first design, with 4 dc motors held up by 4
									precisely cut popsicle sticks, binded by hot glue.

								<h2>Design 2<br />
								Day 2</h2>
								<p>I realized my design previously was fairly heavy and not suitable enough for flight due to the lack
									of power which my motors had. So in response to this, I decided to remodel my design, more accurately
									in a CAD software to have a better approach. This design used half the materials, ending up with half
									of the weight of my original design.

								<h2>Final Project | Takeaways<br />
								Day 3-4</h2>
								<p>I finally set my sights on starting to build my mini drone, scaled 5.75in x 5.75in due to the size 
									my popsicle sticks found in the shelves of my garage. I found some old wires, propellers, and motors from 
									the previous drones that I built with my older brother years previously. After about 2 hours of assembling my drone, binded
									with messy plops of glue from my hot glue gun, which I burned myself about 10 times with, my drone was finally finished. I 
									attached the wires to 2 double A batteries and hoped for the best. But unfortunately it didn't fly.
								</p>
								<p> After 30 minutes of attempting to fix it I finally found the problem. One of my wires werent properly connected
									 leading to all of the motors not being able to work. After I fixed that issue, I unfortunately found another problem.
									  I somehow failed to account that just 2 double a batteries cannot provide enough power to 4 motors. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Ongoing to the next day, I had a new approach of wiring each motor to their own set of batteries. After I was done wiring,
									I turned each motor on and hoped for the best. And I finally did it, even though it wasn't perfect as it can only fly upwards, it finally took
									flight.
								</p>
								</p> Takeaways: Throughout this project, I gained first-hand experience with the engineering design process, including prototyping, testing, failure analysis, and iteration. Despite this drone being a small-scale project, it reinforced the importance of documentation, as I recorded each design decision, identified limitations, and reflected on areas for improvement. Encountering issues such as insufficient power delivery and wiring errors helped me better understand real-world constraints that are not always apparent in pre-built kits. I plan to apply the lessons learned from this project to future, larger-scale designs, using a more structured approach to power analysis, weight reduction, and system integration.

							<h2>VEXU Competitions<br />
							</h2>
							<p>After my experience of interning with The Aerospace Corporation, I wanted to apply my newfound technical abilities of prototyping and collaboration to a team of like-minded engineers. Eventually, I was able to apply my skills through the Cerritos College Engineering & Technology Club competing in VEXU.</p>

								<h2>Mt. San Antonio College VEXU Competition<br />
								Role: CAD Drafter/Prototyper</h2>
								<p> Preparing for my first robotics competition, I served as the CAD Drafter and Prototyper for my team "RCXD2". I collaborated with a teammate to design and develop the robot chassis for the VEX U Pushback competition, where teams score balls into goals to outscore their opponents. After researching potential drivetrain designs, we selected and built an X-Drive chassis for its superior maneuverability and ability to move seamlessly in all directions. Through my internship experience collaborating with professional engineers, my CAD skills improved significantly, allowing me to create and iterate multiple detailed models to support our team’s design and prototyping process.

								<h2>Mt. San Antonio College VEXU Competition </h2>
								<p> After prototyping the X-Drive chassis, we found difficulties in coding the autonomous steering in the design. Alongside heavy time constraints, our team opted for a new chassis (4-Wheel Drive), as it was not only easier to design, but build and code as well. After the CAD model for the Chassis was created, my team and I developed the chassis to be used for both of our robots for the competition.

								<h2>Mt. San Antonio College VEXU Competition<br />
								& Results | Takeaways </h2>
								<p> After developing the chassis for both robots, I collaborated with my team captains to build and refine the upper subsystems. While my team captains focused on creating CAD models for the intake and outtake mechanisms, another team member and I prototyped these designs, identified areas for improvement, and applied iterative adjustments based on testing
								</p>
								<p> The first robot, KV, was built by a teammate and me, with design modifications implemented as needed throughout the build process. The second robot, KD, was developed after our team determined that, given time constraints, a basket-style robot would be the most efficient and feasible solution based on our research.
								</p>
								<p>
									Despite the strict timeline, our team successfully prepared two fully functional robots in time for competition.
								</p>
								<p>
									Takeaways:
Through my first robotics competition, I applied newly developed technical and organizational skills while collaborating with a diverse engineering team toward a shared objective. I contributed to refining our engineering notebook through detailed record-keeping and documentation, supporting our design and iteration process. As a result of our collective efforts, our team placed in the top eight and received the Judges’ Award for the most innovative and unique design. I am excited to build on this experience in future competitions, applying the lessons learned to further improve team performance.
